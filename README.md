# Heap Spawner
Add a compact "coming out of the wall" spawner for stones anywhere on your farm - put it on a building, or coming out of a rock face... have fun! Spawns 5k liters of stone per hour.

Usage note: in some cases, if you place the spawner and nothing is showing up on the ground, it ususally means that the surface it's "over" doesn't allow tipping. Works best when placed over paintable ground.
